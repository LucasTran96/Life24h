Life24h - Free family positioning

Life24h Family Locator simplifies life in the digital world by easily connecting with everyone in your family and the most important people.

Life24h can help you:
• See the real-time location of Circle Members on a family map only visible to your Circles.
• Create your own private groups, called Circles, relatives, teammates - whoever you want and chat with them in Family Locator.
• Receive real-time notifications when Circle Members arrive or leave a location that the members have added (Where to get rid of annoying text? Where are you?)
• See the location of a lost or stolen phone.
• Chat with members of the Circle.
• The function of requesting emergency assistance whenever you encounter difficulties.
• Warning collision danger to Members in the circle so they can help you in time.

Share real-time location

Stay connected and in sync with your entire family and eliminate the many documents needed to coordinate your family events and daily life. The family locator notifies you when your family members are registered at a location and thanks to the GPS sensor in your phone, the family locator can also notify if someone comes late.
